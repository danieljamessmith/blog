This portfolio is made using Quarto, an open source technical publishing system that provides the functionality to render .ipynb and .md files as blog posts. 

The .ipynb files are written in Python 3 using Jupyter Lab.

The mathematics posts are typically written in LaTeX and converted to .md using Pandoc.

I am using GitHub pages to host the site.
