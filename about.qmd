I am Daniel Smith, an aspiring Data Scientist and a recent graduate in Applied Mathematics.

I created this blog to serve both as a portfolio to show to potential employers and for the interest of anyone else currently following or considering a similar path.

The blog is made with Quarto, an open source techinical publishing system supporting Jupyter Notebooks. I am using GitHub Pages to host.
