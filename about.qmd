This portfolio is made using Quarto, an open source techinical publishing system that provides functionality to render .ipynb and .md files as blog posts. 

The .ipynb files are written using Python 3 in Jupyter Lab.

The mathematics posts are typically written in LaTeX using Overleaf and converted to .md using Pandoc.

I edit the portfolio repo using VSCode with the Quarto extension. I am using GitHub pages to host the site.
